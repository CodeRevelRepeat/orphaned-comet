  Making your bitcoin transfers fun and easy

## Summary ##
  Coinbase's interface can be unintuitive, especially when all you want to do is transfer small bits. Utilizing our web application, you connect your coinbase account to a personal handle and our app will handle all the hassle of transfers, just tell us who you want to send it to.  

## Problem ##
  Using bitcoin can be difficult, this makes it easy.

## Solution ##
  Juggling wallets and keys can be a pain, and sometimes you don't want people to know the email attached to your coinbase account. Our app will handle the routing and request handling and abstract it away into a slick and neat looking one page process.
