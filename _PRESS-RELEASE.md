## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Coinbase's interface can be unintuitive, especially when all you want to do is transfer small bits. Utilizing our web application, you connect your coinbase account to a personal handle and our app will handle all the hassle of transfers, just tell us who you want to send it to.  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Using bitcoin can be difficult, this makes it easy.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Juggling wallets and keys can be a pain, and sometimes you don't want people to know the email attached to your coinbase account. Our app will handle the routing and request handling and abstract it away into a slick and neat looking one page process.
